I"ù<p>Hello everyone, welcome to my static site. Iâ€™ve generated this site using <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, its fun because its simple, doesnâ€™t require coding skill and using no database so you can simply host it in github like this one i make.</p>

<p>In the future maybe i will post something about my development experience, my project progress, reviewing some of websites, creating something that we can learn it together and anything else that i think i have to make.</p>
