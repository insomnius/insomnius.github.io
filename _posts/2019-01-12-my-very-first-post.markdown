Hello everyone, welcome to my static site. I've generated this site using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), its fun because its simple, doesn't require coding skill and using no database so you can simply host it in github like this one i make.

In the future maybe i will post something about my development experience, my project progress, reviewing some of websites, creating something that we can learn it together and anything else that i think i have to make.
