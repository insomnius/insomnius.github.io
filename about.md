I’m a passionate software engineer that focuses mainly on backend and have expertise in microservice architecture, kubernetes, development cycles, development principles and distributed architecture. I’m eager to learn new terms and skill in this industry and aim to pursue a career as a software architect.

I believe good technology is not technology that has all the complex science in it, but one that has a good impact on others and develops the bonds between the user and the creator.

My intention in creating this website is to share my knowledge so that others can benefit from it.
